This exam required taking the preamble to the consitiution of the united states (or any other text input).
The words were randomly scrambled, and divided by string length into even and odd lengths.The even
words were brought to lowercase, and transformed into pig latin. While the length was "sum factorialed".
The odd words were raised to upper case, string lengths factorial, and posted to thier own grouping. All the 
posted words were set according to a timer and every word is linkable to a google search on the word.
